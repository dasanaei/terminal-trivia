# terminal-trivia
A trivia game that obtains questions from the TriviaDB API. Each game allows users to choose from easy, medium or hard level questions from 14 categories. A timed scoring algorithm allocates points to the player, and all data is locally stored. From this user data, statistics and game averages are generated. 

### Setup:
- Download or clone the repository 
- If on windows, execute the `windows_installation.bat` script.
